⚡ SmartWiring Pro
Next-Gen Electrical Design Software for Safe, Efficient, and Smart Homes and Buildings
A solution built to revolutionize electrical system planning in residential and commercial spaces across India and beyond.

📌 Problem Statement
In India, a large proportion of small and medium-sized buildings are constructed without detailed blueprints for electrical systems, resulting in:

🔧 Difficult Maintenance – Technicians struggle with untraceable wiring layouts during repairs or upgrades.

🔌 Suboptimal Energy Efficiency – Poor wire sizing leads to overloads or overspending on unnecessary wiring.

🧠 Lack of Smart Home Integration – No standardized support for IoT devices and home automation systems.

☀️ Challenges in Solar Adoption – No clear method for integrating solar systems into existing wiring.

💸 High Complexity and Cost – Lack of affordable, accessible tools for electrical design and energy budgeting.

🚀 Solution Overview – SmartWiring Pro
SmartWiring Pro is an AI-powered software tool that empowers homeowners, electricians, architects, and engineers to design safe, efficient, and future-ready electrical systems with ease.
It intelligently analyzes building blueprints, appliance needs, and solar feasibility to generate detailed, optimized electrical layouts.

🧠 Key Features
1. 🏠 House Blueprint Input
Upload blueprints in DXF, SVG, PDF, or connect with AutoCAD/Revit.

Automatically parses floor plans, identifies rooms, and calculates dimensions.

2. ⚡ Power Load Calculation
Input room-wise appliances (e.g., lights, fans, AC).

Auto-calculate wattage per device and total power consumption per room.

3. 🧵 Wire Gauge Optimization
Smart recommendations for wire gauge size (e.g., 2.5mm², 4mm²).

Auto-suggest fuses and MCBs based on load and safety standards.

4. 💡 Energy-Efficient Suggestions
Recommend LED lighting based on lux levels.

Suggest star-rated appliances, smart plugs, motion sensors, and more.

5. ☀️ Solar Integration Engine
Calculate roof area and solar feasibility.

Suggest solar panel type, system size, and estimate ROI/payback period.

6. 📄 Output Reports
Download room-wise reports:

Appliance wattage

Circuit & wire gauge

Circuit protection devices

Solar design & savings

7. 🧩 Interactive Dashboard
Drag-and-drop appliances on 3D blueprint interface.

Real-time updates on power load, wiring, and cost.

8. 📱 Mobile App Integration
View/edit plans on-the-go.

Monitor energy usage and get savings suggestions via app notifications.

📊 Example Use Case
Living Room (200 sq ft):

Device	Wattage	Quantity	Total Load
LED Lights	10W	5	50W
Ceiling Fan	75W	1	75W
AC	1500W	1	1500W
Total Load			1625W

🔁 Output:

Wire Gauge: 4mm²

Circuit Breaker: 20A MCB

Solar Recommendation: 2kW system

Cost Saving Estimation: ₹28,000/year
